  <em><strong>The first iteration of my personal website</strong></em>

<br>

A minimalistic portfolio built with pure HTML and CSS. This is my first website ever published on the web, the beginning of my web development journey.

### Approach / Why
Instead of jumping straight into frameworks, I chose to start with the basics. Building this portfolio with pure HTML and CSS helped me learn solid web fundamentals and a better sense of design, so now Iâ€™m more excited to learn JS/TS and maybe some Tailwind, and I appreciate more why tools like these exist.
